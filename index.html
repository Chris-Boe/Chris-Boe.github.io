          <li>From university work to independent projects, I like to create fun, easy-to-use, and engaging programs ranging from games to instant messaging programs.</li>
		  <li>I love to be challenged and learn new ways to code! Even this website was (quickly) built from scratch.</li>
		  <li>As of my current (junior) year in university, I am familiar with Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript & JQuery. I also have some experience with Python and Ruby.</li>
		  Most of these I try to learn in my downtime using extracurricular resources online, like Code Academy.
		  <li>I currently work in IT Services at my university, Pacific Lutheran, in Washington, and have taken IT Security and Assembly Language classes in London during my study abroad experience at City University London.</li>

					<p>I have played piano for 15 years now and have loved (nearly) every minute of it! Performing and accompanying in recitals, competitions, and shows have kept me busy and dedicated.
					Starting at a young age is the best time to begin fostering a fun, social, and life-long hobby or more! Taking music lessons at some point in life is highly recommended and I couldn't agree more.
					Since high-school, I have enjoyed sharing my knowledge of music and piano with friends and students in my home community.
					Moving on from high-school, I took on new students in Tacoma, Washington. With students ranging from age 6-20, it's a learning experience for all!
					<ul>
					<li>For lessons, I use a variety of books from the Alfred series encompassing both music theory and piano technique.</li>
					<li>I am located in the Tacoma, Washington area and teach those in the local.</li>
					<li>In most cases I use the music rooms at Pacific Lutheran University to teach (the pianos are superb!), however house calls can be arranged.</li>
					<li>You can find my email in the <i><a href="learn-more">contact me</a></i> section on this site for lesson and pay rate queries!</li>
